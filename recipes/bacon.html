<h1>Bacon-wrapped Cherries</h1>
<img src="/odin-recipes/pics/bacon.jpg" alt="Bacon-wrapped">
<p>Cooking time may be increased if you want the bacon crisp, but I think that the bacon is better soft.</p>
<p>Although I have never tried it, I imagine that this recipe would also be good on a grill with a grate small enough that the cherries don't fall through.</p>
<h2>Ingridients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>36 maraschino cherries, stemmed, drained and juice reserved</li>
    <li>18 slices bacon slices, halved</li>
    <li>36 toothpicks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
    <li>Wrap each cherry with a bacon half, secure with a toothpick, and arrange on a baking sheet. Drizzle reserved cherry juice over wrapped cherries.</li>
    <li>Broil in the preheated oven until bacon is crisped to your liking, 3 to 10 minutes.</li>
