<p>If you only have one spatula, wrap your other hand in an old dish towel for protection, and use it to press down on the spatula with both hands.</p>
<p>You can make 4 (4 ounce) patties instead of 8 (2 ounce patties), but I prefer the thinner patties that have more crispy surface area.</p>
<h2>Ingridients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
    <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
    <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each.</li>
    <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. </li>
</ol>
